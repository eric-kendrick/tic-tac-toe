# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
  Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game app based on the traditional game. Players take turns placing their tokens -in this game hearts and stars- in empty squares to try to connect three of their tokens vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The first player to do so wins, their win is tallied, and a new game begins after the board refreshes.

### Preview of App:


### Context:
 Tic Tac Toe is the culmination solo project in Module 1 of Turing's front-end engineering program, and the project scope required the application to be delivered within seven days. The project was completed utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript without a library.


### Learning Goals:
  The learning goals of this project were to utilize all the knowledge and skills gained throughout Module 1 in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to accomplish the following - 
  * Write clean, DRY Javascript
    * Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward single-responsibility principles 
    * Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
  * Iterate through/ filter DOM elements utilizing clean, thoughtful code
  * Plan and execute a project from start to finish intentionally
    * Plan each iteration of the build and commit to the schedule
    * Document changes with atomic commits
    * Practice responsible pull request and merge disciple

### Wins + Challenges:
  Although this final project functions rather simply, it was my first time planning through a project from beginning to end with minimal instruction or oversight. Planning iterations of features was a challenge, as was determining the best way to approach functional problems. It was deeply satisfying to finally see all of the planning and work come to fruition in a fully-functional, bug free application.
